
Title: Pachinko controller.

Group: Description

The Pachinko controller is a standard joypad controller coupled with a dial.
The dial controls the speed at which the balls are sent.

This controler is used in the following games :

  - Pachio-Kun Jūban Shōbu - >パチ夫くん十番勝負
  - Pachio-Kun Maboroshi No Densetsu - パチ夫くん幻の伝説
  - Pachio-Kun Warau Uchū - パチ夫くん笑う宇宙
  - Pachio-Kun 3 Pachisuro & Pachinko - パチ夫くん3パチスロ＆パチ

Group: Interface

Basically the controller acts as 2 joypads plugged on a 2 ports multitap.
The first and second read of the *joyport* will return the directions and the
buttons. While the third and fourth will give the dial value.

This means that a call to joypad_read will do the trick.
*joypad+0* will contain the joypad directions and buttons and *joypad+1* the
dial.

Note the dial value can range from *$84* to *$fb*. However this value is usually
clamped (*$9c* and *$ef* for Pachio-Kun Jūban Shōbu (パチ夫くん十番勝負)). 

(start code)
    jsr  joypad_read

    ; Clamp dial values.
    lda  joypad+1

    cmp  #$9c
    bcc  @clamp.lo
    
    cmp  #$ef
    bcs  @clamp.hi

    bra  @store

@clamp.lo:
    lda  #$9c
    bra  @store

@clamp.hi:
    lda  #$ef

@store:
    sta  dial

(end code)
